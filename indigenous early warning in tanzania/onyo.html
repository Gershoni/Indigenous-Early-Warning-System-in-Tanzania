    <p>
     Devices which have been used in Early warning 
     systems are diverse, and have also based on the
      types of disasters. Some devices are multi-purpose
       for use in several disasters, whilst some are used
        per see for certain disasters. These devices
         additionally, range from formal to informal
          tools depending on location, users and type of
           disasters. Therefore, Informal devices are 
           natured from indigenous knowledge which have
            been practiced by some societies to predict
             and interpret some signs which to them 
             foretell certain events
    </p>
     <p>
       In records, the application of indigenous knowledge in disaster management has gained global recognition during 
       the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) held in June 1992 in Rio de Janeiro 
       (Coates, 2004; UNEP, 2008). In this conference, the Agenda 21 as one of the environmental agreements signed 
       at UNCED in 1992 emphasizes that governments and intergovernmental organizations should respect, record,
        and work toward incorporating indigenous knowledge systems into research and development programs for sustainable 
        development and environmental conservation.  
     </p>
     <p>
       Other International Summits, such as the 1980 “World Conservation Strategy” by the 
       International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and The World Conference on Science held in Budapest,
        Hungary, from 29th June to 1st July in 1999 also paved a way for the recognition of indigenous knowledge in 
        conservation and human development by recommending that scientific and traditional knowledge should be integrated 
        particularly in the field of development and environmental conservation (UNEP, 2008).  
 
     </p>
     <p>
       Local people have rich of indigenous knowledge to manage and control disasters such as floods. 
       The indigenous knowledge provides local people with a variety of options and innovations to deal with the challenges of 
       disaster like floods and drought in the course of making a living.
     </p>
     <p>
       The local knowledge and skills are instrumental in predicting weather patterns and interpretations, enhance food security,
        enhance coping mechanisms to thwart various disasters like floods in Tanzania, and are also decisive to heal disaster 
        victims. Therefore, to strengthen them to be more effective to manage and control disasters, Indigenous Knowledge should 
        be combined and integrated with culturally sensitive scientific knowledge that outfits the environment of the local
         communities. This is significant in view of the fact that many disaster risk reduction strategies have failed due
          to their inability to fit in with the local context. Similarly, local communities need to be empowered to recognize,
           value, and appreciate the value of their knowledge that they possess, and how it could contribute to reducing disaster
            risks.
